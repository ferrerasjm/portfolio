    <h3 class="verse-heading">— Verse 1 —</h3>
    <p>
       Rising up, back on the street <br>
        Did my time, took my chances <br>
        Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet <br>
        Just a man and his will to survive <br>
        So many times it happens too fast <br>
        You trade your passion for glory <br>
        Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past <br>
        You must fight just to keep them alive <br>
    </p>

    <h3 class="verse-heading">— Chorus —</h3>
    <p>
        It's the eye of the tiger <br>
        It's the thrill of the fight <br>
        Rising up to the challenge of our rival <br>
        And the last known survivor <br>
        Stalks his prey in the night <br>
        And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger <br>
    </p>

    <h3 class="verse-heading">— Verse 2 —</h3>
    <p>
        Face to face, out in the heat <br>
        Hanging tough, staying hungry <br>
        They stack the odds 'til we take to the street <br>
        For the kill with the skill to survive <br>
    </p>

    <h3 class="verse-heading">— Chorus —</h3>
    <p>
        It's the eye of the tiger <br>
        It's the thrill of the fight <br>
        Rising up to the challenge of our rival <br>
        And the last known survivor <br>
        Stalks his prey in the night <br>
        And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger <br>
    </p>

    <h3 class="verse-heading">— Verse 3 —</h3>
    <p>
        Risin' up, straight to the top <br>
        Had the guts, got the glory <br>
        Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop <br>
        Just a man and his will to survive <br>
    </p>

        The eye of the tiger <br>
        The eye of the tiger <br>
        The eye of the tiger <br>
        The eye of the tiger <br>
